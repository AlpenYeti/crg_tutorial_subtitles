00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,180
My name is Brain of Terror and I 
am an NSO at Dublin Roller Derby.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,580
In this video, I'm going to look at 
downloading and running the Scoreboard.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,240
You can go to your favourite search 
engine, type in "roller derby scoreboard"

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,540
and there should be a link to GitHub.

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:19,840
It should take you to this address, 
I will include a link in the description.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,760
The important thing here is the 
Releases link,

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,040
which is going to show you all 
the official releases.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,020
These videos are about version 4 of 
the Scoreboard

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,300
which isn't actually out when I am 
making these videos

10
00:00:30,384 --> 00:00:32,820
because I need to make the videos 
before we put it out

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,760
But principles are the same. So if I 
scroll down here

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,380
there is a section called Assets.
Now, we don't want the source code,

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,500
what you want here is 
crg-scoreboard_VERSION.zip

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,200
so you can click that to download.

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,620
Here's version 4 that I have 
downloaded earlier.

16
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,580
Now, you could click into this to look at it, 
however that would be incorrect

17
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,940
because this is a ZIP file
and what you want to do is extract it

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,840
I am using something called XFCE as 
my window manager,

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,180
whatever you are using, whether it's 
Windows, or Mac or some form of Linux

20
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,600
there should be some way to 
extract a ZIP file.

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,320
In any case, you should now have a folder,
and you can open it up.

22
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,720
I'm on Linux, so I can run scoreboard.sh

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,100
If I was on OSX, on the Mac, I would also
run scoreboard.sh

24
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,260
and for Windows it's just 
scoreboard-Windows.exe

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,760
So basically, Windows users use 
scoreboard-Windows.exe,

26
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,480
everyone else uses scoreboard.sh

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,940
Click that up, and it should run !

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,317
Now, it has a whole pile of ways
 to access it

29
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:36,680
almost always you're going to 
want localhost:8000

30
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,860
and there's the scoreboard.

31
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,100
Most systems these days will 
already have Java installed

32
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,080
because CRG is a Java application

33
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:53,260
you may need however to download JDK 
or JRE in order to get things running.
