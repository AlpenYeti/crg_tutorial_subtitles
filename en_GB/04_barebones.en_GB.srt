00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
My name is Brain of Terror and I am
an NSO at Dublin Roller Derby.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,780
In this video, I'm going to
show you the absolute bare minimum

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,780
you need to know to run the Scoreboard
in less than 5 minutes.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,220
So, let's see what the bare minimum is.
Here's the rules

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,960
They say we need the period clock,
the Jam clock and the official score.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,880
Everything else is nice to have. Great !
So let's open up the Operator panel

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,300
This dialog will come up,
press X

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,800
At some point, the Jam Timer will do
their rolling whistle,

9
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,800
five seconds,

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,800
and start the jam.

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,180
Lead is declared. Lead is not one of the
three things we care about, so nothing to do.

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,720
Some points are put up.

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,680
This will fade...

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,700
More points are put up.

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,600
Now, skaters can only go around the track 
so fast, so that's fine

16
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,280
And then maybe the jam is called,
so the fourth whistle

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,400
is when we want to
press the button.

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,220
twit twit twit TWIT,  twit twit twit twit,
twit twit twit twit

19
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,200
So fourth whistle, not the first
 whistle, not the twelfth whistle.

20
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
So, here we go.

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,120
The official Jam clock and so on is here.

22
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,400
This is the lineup clock, the Jam
Timer should be looking at this,

23
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,380
and on 25 seconds, they should be going "5 seconds",

24
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,760
...

25
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,880
5 seconds

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,140
...

27
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,720
Twit !
So, you press "Start Jam" when they "twit"

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,020
which should be at 30 seconds.
But you press it when they actually "twit".

29
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:44,360
So here we are in the next jam,
maybe there's some points here

30
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,740
then we stop the jam, and hop,
there was a point there at the end.

31
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,000
Grand.
What if I need to adjust the points ?

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,700
Usually, you can use these buttons,

33
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,480
but you can only go down so far.

34
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:05,300
So, if you need to go a bit further back in time
to adjust the score, you can do it down here.

35
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,880
You can click anywhere you see a number
that is bigger than zero and change it.

36
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,500
Just one thing to watch,
you'll notice it says 4+0,

37
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,860
that first 4 is actually over here
 in the No Initial column.

38
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,880
So if I wanted to change that,
I need to click here,

39
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,440
rather than here which is just a 2.

40
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,620
This is a paperwork thing, 
don't worry about it too much.

41
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,540
So, let's say we are going
into the next Jam,

42
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,100
here we go, scores are over here, nice and correct, and we stop the jam.

43
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,820
Now let's say there is going to be a Timeout.
We'll press the Timeout button.

44
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,340
We don't care what sort of Timeout it is,
that's not one of the three things we care about.

45
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,060
We do however care about the Period Clock.
It's possible we are a bit off,

46
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,840
In which case the Jam Timer may ask us
to put a bit of time back on the clock

47
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,840
which we can do with these buttons here.

48
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,440
Fine !
Now.

49
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:08,620
At some point, the Timeout will end, we'll
have a rolling whistle, and we end the Timeout.

50
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,420
There will be a 5 seconds call,
and the Jam will start.

51
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,740
Grand.

52
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,400
Now, this is only a 5-minute video so
we are not going to do an entire period

53
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,740
You might stop the Jam, and I'm just
going to advance time

54
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,740
Start Jam...

55
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,980
... you'll add a few more points...

56
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,940
We are coming to the end of period 1.
There was less than 30 seconds left

57
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,420
on the period clock, so everything goes red to tell you

58
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:49,720
that there shouldn't normally be another
jam in the period unless someone

59
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,140
calls a Timeout or there's a
discretionary Jam or something.

60
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,240
That's fine. So, otherwise that
would just be a zero, cool,

61
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,860
to advance and we are now
in intermission.

62
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,440
An important thing to note : if you
start a Jam now, it will go in Period 1

63
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,240
because there might be a discretionary Jam, or a Timeout or something.

64
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,180
If you want to go into period 2, there needs to be 
less than a minute on the intermission clock.

65
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:18,840
So, I'm just gonna set this down to a second,
intermission is fired, going into period 2,

66
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,340
I start the Jam.

67
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,340
There's some points.

68
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,240
I stop the Jam, and so on and so forth, exact same as before.

69
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,540
I'm once again going
to advance the Period Clock.

70
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,480
And now we're at the end of the game,
we'll presume there's no more Jams.

71
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,080
You'll notice this "End of Period
Controls" is flashing.

72
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:44,060
So you click on that, and what you do is,
you wait for the Score Keepers and

73
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,040
and the Jam Refs to confirm
that the scores are final,

74
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,060
and if there's an Overtime Jam,
Start Jam is right over there

75
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,660
Once it's all confirmed and all, you
click "Unofficial Score"

76
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,700
and this will now say Final Score.

77
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,700
So, that is the bare minimum you need
to know in How to Operate the Scoreboard

78
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,700
in less than 5 minutes.
