My name is Brain of Terror and I
am an NSO at Dublin Roller Derby.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,020
In this video, I'm going to look at how to
setup a projector with the Scoreboard.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,600
Here we have a Scoreboard in the
usual case where the system running

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,220
the scoreboard is the same one
 that is hooked up to the projector.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,300
So, on localhost:8000, we hit
Main Scoreboard.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,380
Now you will have the projector
hooked up to the machine

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,420
and with an extended desktop so you
will drag this to the left

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,160
or to the right so it will end up
in the right place, and then

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,500
you want to fullscreen this
which is usually F11.

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,440
Great.
That's all working.

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,300
Now, what if the machine that you want
the projector

12
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,700
to run from is not the same
machine with your scoreboard on ?

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,140
You'll need to setup some form of
network between them via using WiFi,

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,720
cables, or something. I am not going to
go into those sort of details.

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,560
But once you've got a network set up,
you'll notice this Info section here

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,140
which mentions a whole pile of ways
you might be able to get to the Scoreboard.

17
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,520
The one you're looking for is
probably the 192.168 one,

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,760
might be 172 that would be unusual,
but normally 192.168

19
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:18,200
So, I can go to this other machine
which has the projector on, type in

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,880
192.168.1.13:8000 which happens
to be the value in this case,

21
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,700
use whatever the right value is,
and it's the same view,

22
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,660
so from this machine that has the
projector, go to Main Scoreboard,

23
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,060
drag it if needed,
and press F11 to fullscreen.

24
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,560
And that is how you setup the
Scoreboard with a projector.
