00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,300
My name is Brain of Terror and I am
an NSO at Dublin Roller Derby.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,820
I am also one of the scoreboard
developers.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:13,060
In this set of videos we are going to be 
looking at version 4 of the Scoreboard.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,160
This is the latest release for 
the whole pile of new features

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,660
 so in these videos I am not going 
to try and cover everything at once.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,580
 Roller derby is a relatively
complex game in terms of stats,

7
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,300
there is lots of business rules
and so on to go into

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,520
so you might see something at screen
I don’t discuss or that’s a little off

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,540
that’s just because it’s going to be 
in a later video.

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,840
So the big thing about version 4 of the
 scoreboard is all the stats support.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,880
 There’s now full WFTDA
statsbook support

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,560
 which is largely due to Speedy 
Convalesce who is with Star Track.

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,880
Erm, so, we will be looking at all of that,

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,100
 like Penalty Tracking, 
Line-up Tracking and so on.

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,360
 If you have any questions
about the scoreboard

16
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,800
 the best place to ask is on the Derby 
Scoreboard Facebook group

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,040
 which I’ll put a link to in the
 description below.

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,060
In terms of history

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,780
CRG stands for Carolina Roller Girls

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,400
 who started the scoreboard some 
10-ish years ago.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,940
They are no longer involved but 
we still have the name,

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,840
 and we are on like third or fourth set 
of developers,

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,260
which is pretty good going as open
source projects go.

24
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,320
 So I hope you find these videos useful.
